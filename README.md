# MVP Scaffold

OPTIONAL: Use the provided scaffold to start your MVP project. It has everything you need to get started with an Angular or React client, a node express server, and a MySQL or Mongo database. If you choose to use this scaffold, please spend some time familiarizing yourself with how the pieces are connected after following the set up directions below. 

**Important note:** Take the time to understand all of the code that is given to you before you write *any* code yourself.

### Front End Set Up - React

To transpile your files, you'll use webpack, which you'll need to have globally installed. 

### General Set Up

Remove unneeded folders from the repo and unneeded dependancies from package.json. Examine the `package.json` for helpful scripts.
